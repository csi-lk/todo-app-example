# Todo App Example

Todo app for web coding challenge

## Starting

install all deps with `yarn`

Then run

`yarn start`

## Dev Notes

Using nano id for uuid as it's much faster for the tradeoff of a few conflicts (that most likely are not going to occur)

I've written a lot of functional tests for this to prove it works for the user - https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests/ (if I had more time I would have written component tests as well)
